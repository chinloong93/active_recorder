# ActiveRecorder
A Ruby Gem to visualize ActiveRecord tables in a Rails app. Creates a controller, view and route to visualize ActiveRecord tables

# How to use
require 'active_recorder'

ActiveRecorder.record('path/of/rails/app')

Now go to the url for your rails app 'http://yourrailsapp.com/tables' to see the visualization

Caveat: Only works with unedited migration files generated by rails
